                You won't just accomplish more.
                You'll feel happier and more fulfilled along the way.
           
                We think that productivity is all about hard work. That the road to success is lined with endless frustration and toil. But what if there's another way?
          
                Studies like one conducted at <span class="highlight">St. Lawrence University</span> and another at  <span class="highlight">Tokyo Medical </span> and <span class="highlight">Dental University</span> have shown an association between chewing gum and increased alertness, blood flow to the brain, and improved memory. These factors could contribute to enhanced focus and productivity.
